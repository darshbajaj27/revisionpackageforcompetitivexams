T(K)= T(⁰C) + 273.15
Molarity (M)= No. of Moles of Solutes/ Volume of Solution in Liters
Unit: mole/ L
Molality (m)=
No. of Moles of Solutes/ Mass of solvent in kg
Molecular Mass= 2x vapor density
Atomic number=
No. of protons in the nucleus = No. of electrons in the nucleus
Mass number=
No. of protons + No. of neutrons C= vλ
Boyle’s Law:
P1V1 = P2V2 (at constant T and n)
Charles’s Law:
V1/ T1 = V2/ T2 (at constant P and n)
Enthalpy:
H = U + pV
First Law of Thermodynamics:
ΔU = q + W
Ohm’s Law:
V = RI where, R = ρ ι/a
Faraday’s Laws
Faraday’s First Law of Electrolysis:
M = Zit
M = mass of substance deposited
Z= Electrochemical Equivalent
I = current,
t= time
Z= Atomic Mass/ n x F
Faraday’s Second Law of Electrolysis:
M1/ M2 = E1/E2 ,
Where E = equivalent weight
