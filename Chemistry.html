1. What does BOD stand for?

2. The upper stratosphere of the ozone layer protects us from the sun’s radiation that falls in which wavelength region?

3. What substance used in dry cleaning is a better strategy to control environmental pollution?

4. Name the structure of silicate in which two oxygen atoms of [SiO4]4- are shared.

5. Monosaccharides and disaccharides are differentiated by?




Answer1)BOD stands for Biochemical Oxygen Demand.
Answer2)The Ozone protects us from the sun’s radiation that falls in the 200-315 nm wavelength region.
Answer3)Liquid carbon dioxide is better for replacing conventional halogenated solvents (potentially carcinogenic).
Answer4)In linear chain silicate, two oxygen atoms per tetrahedron are shared.
Answer5)Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones. Carbohydrates may have an aldehyde group (aldoses) or ketose group. Barfoed’s test distinguishes monosaccharides from disaccharides. In this test, copper acetate in dilute acid is reduced in 30 seconds by monosaccharides, whereas disaccharides take several minutes.
