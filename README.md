# revisionpackageforcompetitivexams

I have designed a simple yet comprehensive revision and 
recreation package for a student. The need for this arose from our 
own need to revise quickly and, familiarize ourselves with the new 
pattern of online testing in Competitive Exams. 
The Source Code features a Quiz/Question Bank on different 
Subjects, along with an option to enter the marks obtained and 
view the results graphically. It also features a simple calculator to 
allow us to perform mathematical operations easily and, a 
Formula Book, which lists all the key concepts of the various 
topics in a subject. 
The code also features the option to play an interesting, small 
Game and also showcases a solution to the most common 
problem which students face, Low Marks. 
*THIS IS MY MSP, AND THAT IS HOW IT DIFFERS FROM BYJUS AND PHYSICSWALLAH ETC*
 
I added the above two options after I realized that nowadays a lot 
of stress is taken by our friends over marks and that they have 
almost forgotten recreation. 
There is also an option to calculate oneâ€™s rank using Percentile, 
the latest marking system used in Competitive Exams. 
 
The Quiz opens externally on a web page, using the Web Browser 
Module to access the stored file.  
The Graphical display is using the matplotlib library of Python. The 
Formula Book is stored in a text file and accessed with the help 
of File Handling in Python.

PS: You may need to change the address of the HTML files in the code.
